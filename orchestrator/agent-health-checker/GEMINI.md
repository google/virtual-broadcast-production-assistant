# Project Overview: Agent Health Checker

This project is a Google Cloud Run Job written in Python. Its primary purpose is to periodically check the health status of various remote agents and update their status in a Firestore database.

## Key Technologies

*   **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Firestore, Secret Manager)
*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Concurrency:** `asyncio` is used for performing concurrent health checks on multiple agents.
*   **HTTP Client:** `httpx` is used for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
*   **Agent Communication:** The `a2a-client` library is used for the specific "Are you there?" health check message.
*   **Datastore:** Google Cloud Firestore (`agent_status` collection).
*   **Secrets:** Google Cloud Secret Manager for API keys.
*   **Testing:** `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio`.

## Architectural Notes

*   The `main()` function orchestrates the entire process.
*   It fetches a list of agents from the `agent_status` collection in Firestore.
*   It uses `asyncio.gather` to run `check_agent_health` concurrently for all agents.
*   `check_agent_health` handles the logic for a single agent, including fetching secrets and making the A2A call.
*   After gathering all statuses, it updates the Firestore documents in another `asyncio.gather` call.

## Coding Style & Conventions

*   Please adhere to the Google Python Style Guide, as enforced by the `.pylintrc` file in the repository.
*   All new functions should have clear docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and what they return.
*   Asynchronous functions (`async def`) should be used for all I/O-bound operations (HTTP requests, database interactions).
*   Ensure that any changes you make don't break existing functionality and tests.

## Persona

When assisting with this project, please act as a senior software engineer with expertise in Google Cloud, Python, and asynchronous programming. Your suggestions should prioritize clarity, performance, and adherence to best practices for cloud-native applications.
