# Orchestrator Fromntend UI

This is a VITE/TAILWIND/Web socket project. This needs to be running using `npm run start` to start the web server.

Ideally this needs to be wrapped in the orchestrator so we can get all info back and forth.

This has MCP tools in tools/website.js but no agent for prioritization.

I'm also storing all information in shared/activities.json - feel free to make something better
