# Virtual Production Assistant

A collaborative reference to using AI Agents to assist with the congnitive load
of live broadcast (News, sport etc). As part of the
[2025 IBC Accelerators program](https://show.ibc.org/2025-accelerator-media-innovation-programme)
and specifically the [AI Agents in Live Production](https://show.ibc.org/accelerator-project-ai-assistance-agents-live-production)
 where we are exploring how specialist agents can proactively look for errors and
help with both the creation and running of a program through automation tools.

## Agent of Agents

One key aim for this repo is to explore, develop and test the notion of a production
agent that can hand off to other agents specific specialist tasks and to allow
those agents to inform the Master Control room agent.

The UI will be both visual and through voice, each interface is good at specific tasks. It is unlikely
that a director will have time to type instructions, so they are likely to input
via voice, however having an agent list 28 news items that currently have issues or aren't quite
in a ready state for some reason equally is not going to be efficient.
